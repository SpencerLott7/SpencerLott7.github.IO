                    This project was the very first Unity project I created in my first year with GIMM. It is a basic
                    side scrolling 2-D platforming game that has you traversing platforms
                    and collecting berries on your quest to free the princess from the snakes. The overall Unity project
                    took me about two months and the game trialer displaying it took about two weeks.
                    This project being my first experience with Unity definatly surprised me with what I could make. I
                    learned a lot about project timelines and the implementation of my ideas into
                    game mechanics and story aspects.

                The goal of this collaborative work was to create a compelling story while incorporating some ideas from 
                Quantum Entanglement. The direction we went was to show a love story featuring shapes as characters. We did this 
                to simplify the story and let the reader focus on the idea of pairs in quantum entanglment. A sa team we were able to 
                make an interesting story that funtioned well as a visual reading expoerience in Unity.
