                    am passionate about 3D Design and Game Development. I have been able to participate in projects
                    involving tools such as Unity, OpenXR, Blender, Adobe Creative Suite, and Visual Studio. I have
                    learned these tools and developed
                    websites and VR and AR experiences. Below are some examples of what I have worked on.

                    This project was the very first Unity project I created in my first year with GIMM. It is a basic
                    side scrolling 2-D platforming game that has you traversing platforms
                    and collecting berries on your quest to free the princess from the snakes. The overall Unity project
                    took me about two months and the game trialer displaying it took about two weeks.
                    This project being my first experience with Unity definatly surprised me with what I could make. I
                    learned a lot about project timelines and the implementation of my ideas into
                    game mechanics and story aspects.

                    The goal of this collaborative work was to create a compelling story while incorporating some ideas
                    from
                    Quantum Entanglement. The direction we went was to show a love story featuring shapes as characters.
                    We did this
                    to simplify the story and let the reader focus on the idea of pairs in quantum entanglment. A sa
                    team we were able to
                    make an interesting story that funtioned well as a visual reading experience in Unity.
